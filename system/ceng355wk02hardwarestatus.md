## This week in class
- Winter 2024: in person class ended up being cancelled so the professor ended up doing most of the report uploading/renaming but the firmware other than that of the repository owner should be done be the students.
- Each student is to upload their CENG 317 Final Report to the [hardware](hardware) folder and their actual firmware (hardware code) to the [hardware/firmware](hardware/firmware) folder by clicking by clicking Add file->Upload files.
- Combining these will be on hold for now: The group is to upload their Hardware Project Schedule/Gantt Chart, Budget and/or [Bill of Materials](https://github.com/PrototypeZone/ceng317/blob/main/hardware/bom.md) to the [hardware](hardware) folder and their Final PCB design to the [hardware/pcb](hardware/pcb) folder.
- This week's homework includes a hardware status update [wk02hardware.md](wk02hardware.md) to completed by student one with sensor/effector 1/A on behalf of the whole group and all the sensors/effectors - the other group members should proof read it. In each of the following weeks we will rotate through giving the other students in your group primary responsibility for a status report. The report, when printed out, should fit on a single sided letter sized page, reporting on the status of all of the team members' independent progress.
- Grading (/5):   
   - /1 Safety/Hardware present? - Changed to students uploading/renaming their firware appropriately to the recently relocated /hardware/firmware/ directory on your group's repository with a filename similar to that which the professor chose for your hardware reports.
   - /2 Inserting a group specific declaration of authorship in to [ceng355report.md](ceng355report.md) but not uploading your actual signature nor your student number.
   - /0.5 Hardware Status Report Document [wk02hardware.md](wk02hardware.md) Style and Format
   - /0.5 Recent and current progress
   - /0.5 Problems and hyperlinks such as those to uploaded documents
   - /0.5 Financial update
