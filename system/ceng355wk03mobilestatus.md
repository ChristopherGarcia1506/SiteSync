# CENG 355 Week 03 Mobile Status
## Weekly checks for every student:
- /1 Present in person in a safe manner for the duration of the class: glasses, no food/drink, etc.
    - If class transitions to online due to, say, snow then online participate by interacting online and contributing to project work will be assessed instead.
- /1 Hardware and any other project equipment present.  
## This week
- Discussion of enclosure updates such that the case could theoretically work for all of your group's sensors/effectors (use Inkscape).   
   - Note that Inkscape brings in Illustrator svgs at 1.000000 px per user unit while it should actually use:   
      -File->Document Properties-> Format: Custom pt   
                               -  -> Scale: 1.000000   
                               -  pt per user unit   
- Discussion of redesign of PCB for group in KiCad.
