# Database Status Update
## Recent and current progress
This week we started discussing diffrent options for our enclousure, and talking more indepth about the 
fourth sensor to incorperate for our project, our options that we discussed were a servo motor and a qwicc keypad from sparkfun electronics,
our final dicison ended up being that we will set our final project goal of incorporating the keypad into our project, but with the short term
goal of getting the servo to work with our current existing hardware setup. because of these new additions, we will be having to look at how these new
sensors can fit into our new enclosure that we are desinging this week.
